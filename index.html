                            Dr. Farhang Aslani was born in Noor, Mazandaran in Iran on July 28, 1957. He graduated from Alborz High School in 1975. Upon graduation from high school, he was accepted to several universities in Iran among which he selected the Civil/Structure Engineering program at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran. He received his BS degree in 1983. During his undergraduate studies and after graduation, he worked in Iran on a variety of important national projects such as design and development of floating bridges. After working in Iran for two years, he decided to pursue his graduate work at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. He left Iran in 1985 for his higher education but his heart was always with his country and since his departure he helped with a variety of educational and research projects in Iran.

His desire to learn and work in the Auto Industry encouraged him to enroll again at the University of Michigan in the Aerospace Engineering. While pursing his second master degree, he started to work for a consulting company in Ann Arbor Michigan managing the company's personnel at Ford Heavy Truck Division. In 1994, he accepted a position as a Supervisor at Ford Motor Company supporting a number of vehicle programs.

                          Another milestone in his professional life came as soon as he graduated from the University of Michigan Business School. He transferred from the Product Development to Ford Motor Credit Company in 1996. Between 1996 until his untimely death in January 2005, he was in charge of many multi billion dollar projects at Ford Credit and Ford Treasury working on a number of very critical projects such as asset securitization, affiliate financing, and portfolio management.

                          Farhang is survived by his wife of 26 years, Nasrin, and three children, Bahareh, Lauleh, and Mohammad Reza. He had a great love for Persian poetry and Iranian traditional music. He also enjoyed tae kwon do, soccer, and table tennis.

                          In 2001, Farhang was diagnosed with colon cancer. After battling the disease for three years, the cancer had spread to various parts of his body and no other treatment was available. He spent his last days at his home with his family and friends, and finally, on January 19, 2005, he passed away. Through his battle with cancer, his strength and courage in spite of all the adversity he faced was a great lesson for those around him. Farhang was an extremely kind, giving, funny, and insightful individual who touched many lives. He will truly be missed.

                      It is hard to believe that two decades have passed since Farhang left us. As we reflect on his life and commemorate his enduring legacy, we are reminded of the profound impact he had on those around him.

                    <p class="section-subcontent">
                      Farhang's legacy is one of deep significance. It lives on through his family, his children, and now his grandchildren, as well as the countless individuals he mentored and inspired throughout his life. A key part of this legacy is the scholarship established in his name at the University of Michigan's Business School. This scholarship, created to support a full-time engineer pursuing an MBA—a path that mirrored Farhang's own journey while working for Ford Motor Company—has now proudly supported its third recipient

                    <p class="section-subcontent">
                      For those who knew Farhang, his passion for lifelong learning was unmistakable. The scholarship is a fitting tribute to his dedication to education and mentorship. We are proud to share that it is now fully funded in perpetuity, ensuring its presence as long as the university exists. This means that Farhang's commitment to empowering others will continue to inspire future generations.

                      However, the mission does not end here. Our goal is to extend this opportunity to as many students as possible, further amplifying the reach of Farhang's vision. If you would like to honor his memory by contributing to the scholarship, your support would be deeply appreciated. <a href="https://giving.umich.edu/basket/fund/575419" target="_blank"  style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: #000000 0.1em solid;">Please use this link to contribute to the fund</a>.
