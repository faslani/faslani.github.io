                          Farhang is survived by his wife of 26 years, Nasrin, and three children, Bahareh, Lauleh, and Mohammad Reza. He had a great love for Persian poetry and Iranian traditional music. He also enjoyed tae kwon do, soccer, and table tennis.

                          In 2001, Farhang was diagnosed with colon cancer. After battling the disease for three years, the cancer had spread to various parts of his body and no other treatment was available. He spent his last days at his home with his family and friends, and finally, on January 19, 2005, he passed away. Through his battle with cancer, his strength and courage in spite of all the adversity he faced was a great lesson for those around him. Farhang was an extremely kind, giving, funny, and insightful individual who touched many lives. He will truly be missed.
