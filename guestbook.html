                  Dear Sister Nasrin, Bahareh, Lauleh, and Mohammad Reza,
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  Peace be with all of you. These days are indeed the most difficult period of my lifetime in trying to cope with loosing of a NOBLE brother and friend, like our beloved Dr. Farhang Aslani, God's mercy be upon his innocent soul. I therefore, felt obliged to express my personal views of him in anticipation that such effort may produce a reconciliatory outcome in convincing me to come to the realization that Farhang has gloriously joined his LORD.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  In describing Farhang, the words are indeed short and the expressions are scarce. As in the world, a friend is like a ship that carries us, abides with us unfailingly through the calm and rough oceans of life. Farhang's overwhelming sense of connection with people of all kinds was a masterpiece of human ingenuity to raise standards of brotherhood, consciousness, and above all, internal sense of peace and happiness. It is this bond of our friendship with Farhang that allowed us to explore the depth of our human qualities. Yes, this is the connection that I feel with Farhang, and no doubt that others have similar sentiments toward this 'unique' person, who was just kind to the human race and his unconditional love for Allah's creation was admirable.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  Speaking of nobility, and uniqueness of Farhang, I happened to believe that Allah (SWT) chooses His servants to serve as a 'role model' for the rest of humanity, and this is supported by Quranic stories. In this respect, Farhang fulfilled his mission with glory and distinction. He is with his LORD now, but his powerful legacy reminds each one of us that the road to reach the 'Eternal Love' is just being at peace with our destiny and accepting Allah's decision.

                  Dear Mrs. Aslani and Family,
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  Please accept my sympathy at your loss of Farhang. I enjoyed him as one of my best friends during his years at Automated Analysis. He was such a nice person and was always helping others when they had trouble with their projects.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  Two illustrations about Farhang meant a lot to me. I had a doctoral student who had (unknown to me) submitted an abstract for a paper for a national Aerospace meeting. The abstract was accepted and the student told me about it only two weeks before the finished paper was due! I panicked, but remembered that Farhang had done some similar work earlier. Farhang graciously agreed to help the student and they finished the paper in two weeks! I was astounded.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  Secondly, I remembered when you had a daughter who was hurt in a car/pedestrian accident on Plymouth Road. As concerned as he was Farhang showed no bitterness toward the driver or about the accident. I thought he was one of the most mature, forgiving people I had known.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  We are all hoping and praying for the day when the scourge of cover is lifted from humankind. I lost a brother-in-law at age 44 to this disease. Because the tendency for colon cancer tends to ruin families, all we can do is get routine checkups as we get older. Please make sure your children do this later in life.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  Betty and I extend our best wishes and hope for your recovery from your grief. We still treasure a beautiful blanket/wall hanging that Farhang gave to us years ago. You will probably also have many treasured gifts from Farhang to remind you of him.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subcontent">
                  My apologies for missing the funeral. Betty and I are living in California this winter.

                  Farhang, you will always be in our thoughts and hearts. It's hard to believe that you are no longer physically with us since your memories are so much alive. Even though we lost touch for many years, but talk of you would always come up in our family, especially the trips we took together to Ahwaz, Birjand, Shomal and so many other places and I can not still believe how you used to turn in all your homework even after all we used to do. Farhang, you were full of life and we are glad to see that your family, Nasrin, Bahareh, Lauleh and Mohammad Reza all shine and reflect your soul.

                  I have had the privilege of knowing Farhang for 14 years, mostly at distance. While he was still student, we exchanged music tapes. Later, as long as Bahram Taheri our common friend was here, I had the chance of visiting Farhang's house in Ramadan. I found Him a wholesome man, a man of good character, and a role model for all of us.

                  My dear cousin Farhang, I met Nasrin joon, Laleh and Mohammad Reza here in Toronto tonight. It was really hard for me to see your nice family without you. Nasrin joon gave me a nice gift for my graduation. I could see your smiling face when I was opening the envelope. It was impossible for me to reach to this stage of my life without your guidance and support. Exactly on the first day of my arrival in Canada, you came to see me while saying "Welcome to your new life, we came here to support you as a part of Aslani family." I know that I still have this support even if you are not between us since your memory is always with me. Thanks for everything and God bless you.

Please inform me if there are any memorial anniversary is planned for him. I will also try to contribute to his Fellowship.

                  May god bless brother Farhang. I do have a lot of respect for what he did in his life before and after his physical death. He is alive and well remembered among us his friends. Mrs. Aslani, I do have a lot of respect for you and all the hard work that you are doing for brother Farhang, for your children and for all of us as Farhang's friend. Your hard work and dedication gives us all hope and I thank god for giving you strength and wisdom and support.
