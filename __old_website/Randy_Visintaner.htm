    <font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="font-size: 11pt">When I was asked to 
    speak tonight, I was asked if I was &quot;comfortable&quot; speaking at Farhang's 
    memorial. I am not &quot;comfortable&quot; being here tonight, and I don't believe any 
    of us are comfortable being here. However, we are here to honor the memory 
    of a great man who I am proud to call my friend. Farhang was a friend who 
    gave more than he ever asked, and he gave without being asked. Farhang was 
    also an example to many of us. In his academic achievements, he encouraged 
    and mentored many others in their advanced studies. I was one of those 
    people. Farhang encouraged me to get an MBA, and was a mentor while I went 
    through the program. As a Father, he again was an outstanding example for 
    both his family, and all of us. <br>
    <br>
    We have heard tonight about how much his faith was a part of his life. All 
    those that knew Farhang, recognized how profoundly religious he was. His 
    Faith was his foundation and guided him in everything he did. His steadfast 
    faith and his courage were exemplary. He faced his illness with tremendous 
    courage. <br>
    <br>
    Many people have spoken about Farhang's significant accomplishments as an 
    intellectual. In fact, we used to kid Farhang, that some people collected 
    coins or stamps, but he collected degrees. As a community leader, he always 
    found time to be involved. <br>
    <br>
    But one dimension of his personality that I have to talk about was his sense 
    of humor. Farhang had the most sophisticated sense of humor of anyone I have 
    ever met. He never used to belittle another, but rather to laugh at a 
    situation or often himself. He used to make people at ease either in a 
    socially or at work. I have to share an example of that humor. Each time 
    Farhang went back to Iran, he would ask if he could bring me back something. 
    As you all know, Farhang was also an extremely generous person as well, so I 
    learned that I need to put some constraints on him. At the time we had been 
    discussing Persian rugs, and he mentioned that he thought there were small 
    one the size of a mouse pad. He thought they would be about $5.00. So I said 
    a $5.00 rug would be nice. Upon his return, he shows up at my door with a 
    tube. Inside the tube was a 1ft by 2.5ft Persian rug of a $5.00 bill. He 
    said with a big grin on his face, here is your $5.00 rug. Every time I look 
    at that rug, I think only Farhang would think of such a thing, and I have to 
    smile!<br>
    <br>
    We also need to remember that Farhang was part of an incredible team. He had 
    a very special partner in Nasrin (I am not sure of the spelling). She shares 
    his qualities, including a very sophisticated sense of humor. Nasrin, I want 
    to thank you for sharing Farhang with us.<br>
    <br>
    In conclusion, Farhang was a very special man who touched all of our lives. 
    I am honored to have been his friend, and I am a better leader and a better 
    person for having known him.<br>
