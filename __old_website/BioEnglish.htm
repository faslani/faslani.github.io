    <font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Farhang Aslani was born in Noor, Mazandaran in 
    Iran on July 28, 1957. He graduated from Alborz High School in 1975. Upon 
    graduation from high school, he was accepted to several universities in Iran 
    among which he selected the Civil/Structure Engineering program at Sharif 
    University of Technology in Tehran. He received his BS degree in 1983. 
    During his undergraduate studies and after graduation, he worked in Iran on 
    a variety of important national projects such as design and development of 
    floating bridges. After working in Iran for two years, he decided to pursue 
    his graduate work at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
    USA. He left Iran in 1985 for his higher education but his heart was always 
    with his country and since his departure he helped with a variety of 
    educational and research projects in Iran.</font><p align="justify" style="line-height:150%; margin-left:20; margin-right:30; margin-top:14; margin-bottom:0" dir="ltr">
    <font color="#FFFFFF">He earned his Master of Science and Doctorate degrees 
    in Civil Engineering in 1986 and 1989, respectively. His desire to learn and 
    work in the Auto Industry encouraged him to enroll again at the University 
    of Michigan in the Aerospace Engineering. While pursing his second master 
    degree, he started to work for a consulting company in Ann Arbor Michigan 
    managing the company’s personnel at Ford Heavy Truck Division. In 1994, he 
    accepted a position as a Supervisor at Ford Motor Company supporting a 
    number of vehicle programs. He earned his M.S. in Aerospace Engineering in 
    1992 and immediately enrolled in the Business School at the University of 
    Michigan. He received his MBA with high distinctions in 1996.</font><p align="justify" style="line-height:150%; margin-left:20; margin-right:30; margin-top:14; margin-bottom:0" dir="ltr">
    <font color="#FFFFFF">Another milestone in his professional life came as 
    soon as he graduated from the University of Michigan Business School. He 
    transferred from the Product Development to Ford Motor Credit Company in 
    1996. Between 1996 until his untimely death in January 2005, he was in 
    charge of many multi billion dollar projects at Ford Credit and Ford 
    Treasury working on a number of very critical projects such as asset 
    securitization, affiliate financing, and portfolio management. While working 
    at Ford Treasury, he enrolled at the University of Michigan for one last 
    time. He earned a Master‘s degree in Financial Engineering in May 2001. Dr. 
    Aslani was a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).</font><p align="justify" style="line-height:150%; margin-left:20; margin-right:30; margin-top:14; margin-bottom:0" dir="ltr">
    <font color="#FFFFFF">Farhang is survived by his wife of 26 years, Nasrin, 
    and three children, Bahareh, Lauleh, and Mohammad Reza. He had a great love 
    for Persian poetry and Iranian traditional music. He also enjoyed tae kwon 
    do, soccer, and table tennis. </font>
    <p align="justify" style="line-height:150%; margin-left:20; margin-right:30; margin-top:14; margin-bottom:0" dir="ltr">
    <font color="#FFFFFF">In 2001, Farhang was diagnosed with colon cancer. 
    After battling the disease for three years, the cancer had spread to various 
    parts of his body and no other treatment was available. He spent his last 
    days at his home with his family and friends, and finally, on January 19, 
    2005, he passed away. Through his battle with cancer, his strength and 
    courage in spite of all the adversity he faced was a great lesson for those 
    around him. Farhang was an extremely kind, giving, funny, and insightful 
    individual who touched many lives. He will truly be missed.</font><br>
